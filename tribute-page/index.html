            <p>
              Born in 1958 Neil Breen grew up on the East Coast of the United
              States, and developed an interest in film and filmmaking at an
              early age. He studied architecture and initially became a licensed
              architect in California.

              He gained a small following after releasing his first film, Double
              Down. In the years that followed, Breen continued working as an
              architect as a means to finance his next film: I Am Here.... Now.
              This second feature proved to be a breakout hit, reintroducing
              familiar motifs and garnering Breen "a lot of attention." Since
              then, he has established a reputation as a cult amateur filmmaker.

              Breen writes, produces, directs, and stars in each of his own
              films. The characters he portrays hold advanced and often
              superhuman abilities and use them in grandiose struggles against
              corrupt forces and institutions. Fateful Findings features Breen
              as a hacker imbued with supernatural powers by a magical stone he
              found as a child, who uses his skills to expose government and
              corporate corruption, while in Double Down he plays a rogue
              government super-agent.

              Better than Bee movie and Shawshank Redemption, I cried the whole
              way through, true art.

              So so bad. So much so that it was embarrassing to watch.
              Basically, it looks like an older man who owns a low budget porn
              studio, who decides to try and make a sci fi/blue movie, and star
              in it. Truly, one of the worst movies ever made. I only managed 30
              minutes.

              A man living in his car and afflicted with mercury poisoning,
              becomes increasingly delusional and detached from reality, driving
              around the Nevada desert.

              Not only did I gain nothing from watching this film, I believe it
              took something from me.

              This film is trash. I only leave a a 10 star as I am afraid that
              Neil Breen is too technologically advanced and I don't want him to
              bring any bioterror upon me.
